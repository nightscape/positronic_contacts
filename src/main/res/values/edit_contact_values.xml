  <!-- "structured name" component labels 

       Note we're deliberately calling them "first", "middle", and "last" names
       rather than "given", "middle", and "family" because those usage 
       conventions are culturally bound.  For instance, Spanish names typically
       have *two* family names, a patronymic and a matronymic, with the father's
       family name written first, in the "middle" position.  So, as I write,
       the current Spanish Prime Minister's full formal name is Mariano Rajoy
       Brey, with both "Rajoy" and "Brey" being family names.  In less formal
       contacts, the last family name is dropped; he's typically referred to in
       news reports as "Mariano Rajoy".

       If the content provider blows it on synthesizing a display name
       when you've entered a Spanish name correctly, well... I suppose
       we could offer UI that lets you correct it?
